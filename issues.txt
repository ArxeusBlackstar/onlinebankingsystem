- On changing the branch name in Account, the ifsc is not getting updated automatically
- Same with changing the firstname etc, the account_holder_name is not changing
- In transaction_success page, if I enter any bank_reference_id, i could see even others' transactions
- incorporate is_active instead of deleting accounts
- Remove redundancies from models

Minor issues
- More refined CSS
- A better landing page
